WIP

I've always wanted to have my own website but, didn't want it to be a "Portfolio Website". I didn't want it to be something I used to solely impress recruiters. To be a secondary resume that could potentially show that I knew how to make my own website. It didn't seem genuine. But I wanted my own website. 

Recently I've been in a wave of trying to be more creative and constantly working on bettering myself. It's hard to be confident with your creativity espacially when you are an amature in the area. It makes it harder to push something out and showcase it to the world when you're worried that 'Its not good enough'. However, I was fortunate to come across the book 'Show Your Work!' through Ali Abdal. It's a book that teachs you that everyone is an amature. The spirit of being an amature fosters creativity with the inculcation of curiosity. 

Here are a few points from the bool
- You don't have to be a genius
- Think process, not product
- Sharing with people brings feedback, making your product better

Naval's creativity quote

The idea of 'It's not good enough' is somehting that can keep you from every putting things out into the world. Examples: 

Encouragement, 

push something out there

Goal with this website.

Note to self for future

# My personal site

This is my personal website built with NextJS, a ReactJS framework optimised for production. The starting template of this application was basicaly the [NextJS basics tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

Feel free to use this code to help build your own web applications. I'm trying to use best practices as much as possible. Although, try to not copy paste everything.

## Tools used:

- [ReactJS with NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as the application framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to stay away from stupid bugs
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to prevent needing to write and duplicate CSS class names
- [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) as the markdown processer
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to continuously build and deploy the application
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to keep me sane while overthinking this website
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to track production errors
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for privacy focused analytics
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as the linter
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to make my code look pretty
- [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) as a commit hook to run linters and tests

# My personal site

This is my personal website built with NextJS, a ReactJS framework optimised for production. The starting template of this application was basicaly the NextJS basics tutorial. 

Feel free to this code to help build your own web applications. I'm trying to use best practices as much as possible.

## Tools used:
- **ReactJS with NextJS** as the framework
- **TypeScript** to stay away from stupid bugs
- **Vercel** to continuously build and deploy the application

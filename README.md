# My personal site

This is my personal website built with NextJS, a ReactJS framework optimised for production. The starting template of this application was basicaly the NextJS basics tutorial.

Feel free to this code to help build your own web applications. I'm trying to use best practices as much as possible.

## Tools used:

- [ReactJS with NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as the application framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to stay away from stupid bugs
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to prevent needing to write and duplicate CSS class names
- [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) as the markdown processer
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to continuously build and deploy the application
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to keep me sane while overthinking this website

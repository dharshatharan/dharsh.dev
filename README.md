# My personal site

This is my personal website built with NextJS, a ReactJS framework optimised for production.

I use Notion as the CMS (Content Management System) for my Blogs, TILs and Bookmarks. If you're curious what the setup on Notion looks like, check out the [database I use for my blogs](https://dharsh.notion.site/fc9128b6709c45d2b74b55360a1261f2?v=25098d4ebae043e285408772cea6a02a). You can use this link to [duplicate this template](https://dharsh.notion.site/0ee57381a001469e8a03952d1e49d2ef?v=ed9649b4ad2741209412193a3c1d93fc) to your own Notion workspace by clicking the 'Duplicate' button on the top right corner of the page.

Feel free to use this code to help build your own web applications. I'm trying to use best practices as much as possible. Although, try to not copy paste everything.

## Tools used:
